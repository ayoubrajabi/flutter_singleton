# What Is a Singleton?

## The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.



. Ensure that a class only has one instance

. Easily access the sole instance of a class

. Control its instantiation

. Restrict the number of instances

. Access a global variable
